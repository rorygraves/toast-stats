# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Toastmasters District Statistics Visualizer — a data visualization platform for Toastmasters district performance metrics. Live at https://ts.taverns.red.

**Monorepo with npm workspaces:**

- `frontend/` — React 19 + TypeScript SPA (Vite 7, TailwindCSS 4, Recharts, TanStack Query)
- `packages/shared-contracts/` — Zod schemas + TypeScript types (ESM + CJS dual export)
- `packages/analytics-core/` — Analytics computation engine (~58K lines)
- `packages/collector-cli/` — Data scraping CLI (Commander, csv-parse, GCS)

## Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev:frontend              # Vite dev server on port 3000 (proxies /api to :5001)

# Build
npm run build:frontend            # TypeScript check + Vite build
npm run build:shared-contracts    # Build shared types (must build before frontend)
npm run build:analytics-core      # Build analytics engine

# Testing
npm run test                      # Run all workspace tests (vitest --run)
npm run test:frontend             # Frontend tests only
npm run test:collector-cli        # Collector CLI tests only
npm run test:analytics-core       # Analytics core tests only
npm run test:coverage             # All tests with coverage (55% threshold)
cd frontend && npx vitest --run src/__tests__/SomeTest.test.tsx  # Single test file

# Linting & Formatting
npm run lint                      # ESLint all workspaces (max 500 warnings)
npm run lint:yaml                 # Lint GitHub workflows and docs YAML
npm run format                    # Prettier write
npm run format:check              # Prettier check only

# Quality gate (runs typecheck + lint + yaml lint + format check + tests)
npm run quality:check

# Pre-commit hook (typecheck + lint + yaml lint)
npm run pre-commit
```

## Architecture

**Data flow:** Collector CLI scrapes Toastmasters dashboards → transforms + computes analytics → uploads to GCS as CSV/JSON snapshots → Frontend reads pre-computed snapshots from CDN via TanStack Query (5-min stale, 10-min GC).

**Frontend structure (`frontend/src/`):**

- `pages/` — 3 lazy-loaded routes: LandingPage, DistrictDetailPage, ClubDetailPage
- `components/` — UI components (tables, charts, cards, modals)
- `hooks/` — Custom hooks (`useDistrictAnalytics`, `useTimeSeries`, `usePaymentsTrend`, `useColumnFilters`, etc.)
- `services/` — CDN/API service layer (`cdn.ts`, `cdnTimeSeries.ts`)
- `contexts/` — Global state (ProgramYearContext, DarkModeContext)
- `utils/` — Utility functions (CSV export, DCP calculations, styling)
- `styles/` — Tailwind CSS layers + component CSS

**Styling:** Tailwind 4 with CSS layers. Dark mode via `[data-theme='dark']` CSS scope. Opacity variants (`text-tm-*-80`) bake in hardcoded rgba and must be overridden explicitly — they don't inherit CSS variable overrides.

**Deployment:** Frontend → Firebase Hosting. Backend → Cloud Run (Docker). Storage → Firestore + GCS. CI via GitHub Actions.

## Engineering Rules (from `tasks/rules.md`)

Read `tasks/rules.md` completely before every task. Key rules:

- **R1** — Never bypass failing tests. No `--no-verify`, `--skip-tests`, assertion pinning, or commenting out tests.
- **R2** — GitHub Actions runners start empty. All data must be explicitly synced from GCS.
- **R3** — Pass program year/date/filters as props from parent. Never re-derive from API response data.
- **R4** — CLI logging: `console.error()` only (stderr). Stdout is for structured JSON output.
- **R5** — Read the last 5 entries in `tasks/lessons.md` before starting any task.
- **R6–R8** — Trace call graphs before refactoring; inventory existing fields before adding new ones; audit full read+write paths when deleting services.

## Active Tripwires

- `SnapshotBuilder.build()` has two district-tracking code paths (success + validation-failure) — must update both.
- DCP goals are **independent**, not sequential. Use `clubPerformance` raw fields, never infer count as Goals 1-N.
- Chart `|| 1` range fallback causes y-axis inversion. Pad symmetrically when `range === 0`.
- `Path.join()` with raw user input = path traversal. Always call `validateDistrictId()` first.

### Test-infra contracts (flakiness epic #917 — don't unknowingly break)

- **Flake detector is sensitive by design (R21).** `scripts/run-flake-detection.ts` pins `--maxWorkers=100%` (the contention amplifier) while the blocking CI `test` job is capped at 50% (`resolveMaxWorkers`). Never "fix" the detector to inherit the cap — it would go blind. The detector is **non-gating per-PR** (a contention blip must not red an unrelated PR); the **0% gate lives on the nightly `flake-sentinel.yml`** (gating via `FLAKE_MAX_RATE=0`, ×30). Coverage instrumentation is kept but thresholds zeroed in the harness (a filtered subset can't meet the 55% whole-repo gate — L135).
- **Unit tests must not full-page-mount (R22).** `npm run test:no-page-mounts:check` fails if a unit-project test imports a `pages/*Page` / `<App>`. Page mounts → `src/pages/__tests__/` or `src/__tests__/integration/`.
- **Quarantine ≠ skip (R1).** `frontend/test-quarantine.json` is empty; an entry needs a reason + tracking issue and is loudly reported by `npm run test:quarantine:check`. Don't bump `testTimeout` to mask contention — root-cause it.

### Sprint-runner stuck-session liveness (epic #933 — don't unknowingly break)

- **The runner reaps stuck sessions; a STALL probe must keep its feed.** Each tick fuses three probes (`scripts/lib/sprint-runner-probes.sh` + `…-liveness.sh`): **commit-age** (no commit 45 min → STALL), **process** (`claude` gone + screen alive → **HUSK**, conclusive; present but CPU ~0 → STALL), **log** (per-session screen logfile is 45-min stale OR its tail collapsed to a repeating loop — the #871 signature → STALL). Fusion: **HUSK alone → reap now**; **≥2 STALL → STUCK** (corroborated); **exactly 1 STALL → SUSPECT** (logged, _never_ reaped — the false-positive guard); else HEALTHY. UNKNOWN is never STALL.
- **The log probe's feed is `RUNNER_LOG_DIR/session-<issue>.log`, written at launch — don't sever it.** `launch_sprint_session` wires it via a per-session screenrc (`logfile` + `deflog on`, launched `-c <rc> -L`; macOS screen 4.00.03 has no `-Logfile`). Without that logfile the log probe is permanently UNKNOWN and the **#871 alive-but-looping zombie becomes undetectable** (commit STALL + process OK + log UNKNOWN = 1 soft signal = SUSPECT, never reaped). The `-dmS <name>` token stays **first** in the screen call so `pgrep -f "SCREEN -dmS <name>"` and the hermetic tests still match. The logfile is deleted on reap + GC (truth-tied lifetime), so a relaunch never reads a dead session's stale loop.
- **Capped relaunch + escalation.** STUCK/HUSK → reap + relaunch fresh, capped at `LIVENESS_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (3); the L086 ship-check skips relaunch if the work already merged. At the cap the runner adds `runner-stuck`, comments, notifies, and frees the slot without relaunching. **To re-arm a session the runner gave up on: remove the `runner-stuck` label.** `--status` prints each session's verdict + probe breakdown + `attempts N/3`.
- **The runner shell tests are macOS-local, not in ubuntu CI.** `scripts/tests/sprint-runner-*.test.sh` use `ps -o lstart` / `stat -f` / `date -v` (the runner is a macOS launchd job) — run them directly (`bash scripts/tests/sprint-runner-zombie-verify.test.sh`) on the runner host. CI green ≠ these ran; verify liveness changes locally.

## Learning Artifacts

- `tasks/lessons/` — Per-file lessons (one discovery each, tagged frontmatter). `tasks/lessons/INDEX.md` is the always-loadable tag index (regenerate with `npm run lessons:index`).
- `tasks/rules.md` — Curated high-signal rules distilled from lessons. Read completely before each task.
- `docs/product-spec.md` — Shipped features, business rules, product decisions.

### Per-sprint relevant-lessons manifest (#650)

A sprint sub-issue body **SHOULD** include a `## Relevant lessons` section when there are specific lessons the spawned session must read. The bootstrap prompt (step 1) loads these in full — operator curation wins over the loader's tag inference. Format (one bullet per lesson; the trailing reason is optional but recommended):

```markdown
## Relevant lessons

- [Lesson 087](tasks/lessons/087-spawned-sessions-need-their-own-worktree-not-shared-checkout.md) — branch a long-lived worktree from origin/main, not the stale base
- [Lesson 092](tasks/lessons/092-workspace-package-dist-is-gitignored-and-not-auto-rebuilt.md) — rebuild workspace dist before tests
```

Only the strict `- [text](path)` (or `* [text](path)`) bullet form is recognized — a colon separator or a space before `(` is silently skipped. Dry-run what a session would load with `scripts/relevant-lessons.sh <issue#>` (or `--stdin`): it prints each resolved path and exits non-zero if a listed lesson file is missing.

## Key Conventions

- **Prettier:** 80 chars, single quotes, no semicolons, trailing commas
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode, no implicit any. Zero TS errors required for CI.
- **Filter pipeline pattern:** `original → filtered → searchFiltered → sorted`. Add new filters as steps, don't replace existing ones (R11).
- **CSS pattern for cross-cutting concerns:** Override at CSS level (`[data-theme]`), not component level (R10).
- **GCS-backed store pattern:** Sync from GCS → upsert → save → push back. See `ClubTrendsStore` and `TimeSeriesIndexWriter` as reference implementations (R9).

## Brand (Red Taverns v1.0)

- **Source of truth:** [`taverns-red/ops:docs/brand/`](https://github.com/taverns-red/ops/blob/main/docs/brand/) ([ADR 0004, 2026-04-22](https://github.com/taverns-red/ops/blob/main/docs/strategy/decisions/0004-brand-v1-2026-04-22.md)). Public guide will live at `taverns.red/brand` once the portal migration ships.
- **Tokens file:** `frontend/src/styles/tokens/rt-brand-v1.css` — local copy-on-release of upstream `tokens.css`. **Do not hand-edit** — change upstream and re-sync. Imported from `frontend/src/index.css`.
- **Namespace:** `--rt-*` (e.g. `--rt-red`, `--rt-ink`, `--rt-paper`, `--rt-font-display`). Product accent for this app is `--rt-stats` (#D4873F, amber). Coexists with legacy `--color-tm-*` / `--loyal-*` / redesign.css tokens until Phase 2 chrome migration lands.
- **Fonts:** Space Grotesk (display), Inter (body), JetBrains Mono. Space Grotesk + Inter are preloaded from `frontend/index.html` alongside the legacy Montserrat / Source Sans 3 pair. **JetBrains Mono preload is intentionally deferred to Phase 2** — `var(--mono)` (the redesign-tokens `--mono`, NOT `--rt-font-mono`) already has 8 live consumers in `app-shell.css`. Preloading swaps the text from ui-monospace mid-render and regresses CLS from ~0.012 to ~0.199 (Lighthouse threshold is 0.1; caught on PR #595). Re-enable in the Phase 2 PR with metric-matched `size-adjust` fallbacks or self-hosted woff2. See [Lesson 81](tasks/lessons/081-phase-gated-deferral-tests-move-with-the-spec.md).
- **Phase 2 (chrome migration) is BLOCKED on the rename decision** ([`ops#37`](https://github.com/taverns-red/ops/issues/37) — Toast Stats → Tally). When that decides, the re-skin lands with the rename in one combined PR; the legacy font pair is dropped then. Until then, the brand tokens are available for new components but the existing chrome stays on legacy tokens.

## Workflow Protocol

### Before Starting Any Task

1. Read the last 5 entries in `tasks/lessons.md` (R5).
2. Read `tasks/rules.md` completely.
3. Create or identify a GitHub issue (`gh issue create` or `gh issue list`). All commits and PRs must reference the issue number.
4. Use `EnterPlanMode` for any task requiring >3 steps.
5. If root cause is unknown, run an experiment using `tasks/experiment_template.md` in a canary file first.

### Implementation Loop (TDD)

1. **Red** — Write/run a test that fails for the right reason → commit
2. **Green** — Write the minimal code to pass the test → commit
3. **Refactor** — Clean the code while tests stay green → commit
4. **Verify** — Run the full test suite to confirm zero regressions
5. Repeat. Never skip or combine steps.

### Commit Discipline

- Commit every 15–30 minutes of active work. Each commit = one logical change.
- Every commit message must reference the tracking issue (e.g., `feat: add validation (#42)`).
- Follow conventional commits. Never batch unrelated changes.

### Definition of Done

**Lightweight DoD** (≤1 file, no business logic/tests/API changes):

- No assertion pinning. All pre-existing tests pass. Codebase is releasable.

**Full DoD** (everything else):

- Failing test existed before the fix. Targeted tests now pass. No assertion pinning.
- All tests pass. Zero regressions. CI green. Live verification passes on the **PR preview channel** — the per-PR Firebase URL posted as a sticky comment by `pr-preview.yml` — **pre-merge, not prod**. (Prod deploys are decoupled from per-sprint verification.)
- Change is single-responsibility. Dead code and experiment files deleted.
- **Learning captured — only if there was one.** Not every sprint yields a transferable insight, and a "no new lesson" sprint is a valid outcome. When the sprint did surface something durable, file it by kind in `tasks/lessons/` with frontmatter: **principle** (→ `category: principle`, candidate for an R-rule), **lesson** (→ `category: lesson` + `tags:` for relevance matching), or **incident** (→ `category: incident` + `auto_load: false`, reference-only). A restated commit message is not a lesson — if you cannot name the transferable takeaway in one sentence, do not file one. Regenerate `tasks/lessons/INDEX.md` (`npm run lessons:index`) when you add a lesson.

### Hard Stop

If "Green" state cannot be reached in 3 iterations: revert all changes, document why the hypothesis failed, ask the user for architectural clarification.
